Assignment 1 is a duplicate assignment 7 from C++ 1, so
 I excluded it. 

Assignment 6 is absent as for some reason the the code
 has broken, dispite working just fine before turning it 
 in. 

Assignment 7 is absent as the instructor 
 accidentally included a solution in the examples.
 he allowed me to turn that in, with "Don't reinvent 
 the wheel" being his reasoning
