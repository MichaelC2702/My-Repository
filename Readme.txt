All files in the Schoolwork folder still have the comments from when
 they were created.

If it helps, I took both Python courses before the C++ courses. I 
 also had the same teacher for all four, so some of the comments 
 may be informal.

The file "ClarkeHeading.cpp" that appears in my c++ assignmnents was
 provided at the start of the course and whenever there was extra 
 code needed, such as Assignment 5 in C++ 1 for system time.
